# Local deployment method

This method is written with reference to [Static Deployment Version of Immediate Short Article](https://blog.zhheo.com/p/557c9e72.html), and is adapted by Evan Luo to the Redefine theme.

The implementation logic is to write the content of talk in the local `yml` file, and then generate talk when generating a blog.

## Effect

## configuration

import {Steps} from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Steps>

### Create talk page

The page name can choose `shuoshuo` or `essays` or `essay`

Execute the command in the root directory of the Hexo blog

```shell
$ hexo new page essays
```

At this point a page called `essays` is created

### Edit page name

Open the `/source/esssays/index.md` file (choose according to the name of the page you created), and change the `title` attribute in `front-matter` to the Chinese `Talking` or `Essays`.

Since the page template is matched according to the page name by default, if you want to change the page name to another name, please add `type: shuoshuo` in `front-matter`

for example

```markdown
---
title: test page
type: shuoshuo
date: 2023-03-08 10:38:34
---
```

### Create a talk about storage file

Create a folder `_data` under the `source` directory in the blog root directory (if it has not been created before)

Then create the file `essays.yml` under the `_data` directory

Write your content in this format

```yaml
- content: The first article talks about the content
   date: 2019-01-01 10:00:00 #Talk about the date

- content: The second article talks about the content
   date: 2019-01-02 10:00:00
```

Then visit this page to see what you said.

## Writing Prompts

Talk about supporting Markdown writing.

If you need a line break, please write as follows

```yaml
- content: |
     Talk about the test, this is the fourth, newline test
     Talk about the test, this is the fourth, newline test
     Talk about the test, this is the fourth, newline test
     Talk about the test, this is the fourth, newline test
   date: 2019-01-04 10:00:00
