"Redefine" hexo theme is **a simple & fast & pure theme**, but with **no compromise**. This theme contains lots of widely use functions and great web design.

Hexo Theme Redefine source code is based on [hexo-theme-keep](https://github.com/XPoet/hexo-theme-keep). Redefine Theme optimized its style and added useful writing modules and plugins. Also, you can customize many things in this theme.
