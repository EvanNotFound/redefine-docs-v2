# migrate from v1

If you are using the v1.x.x version of the Redefine theme, it is recommended to upgrade to the v2.x.x version as soon as possible.

The v1 version is no longer maintained, and the v2 version has refactored the code and is no longer compatible with the configuration files of the v1 version.

So you need to follow the steps below to migrate the v1 version of the configuration file to the v2 version.

If you still need to read the v1 version of the document, you can visit [v1 version of the document](https://redefine-docs-v1.ohevan.com/).

## Migration steps

import {Steps} from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Steps>

### Backup v1 config file

After **updating the theme**, rename your v1 configuration file `_config.redefine.yml` to `_config.redefine.v1.yml`

### Create v2 configuration file

**Create** `_config.redefine.yml` file in the root directory of the site, and then [here](https://github.com/EvanNotFound/hexo-theme-redefine/blob/main/_config.yml) configuration File **Copy in**.

### Migrate configuration items

In the configuration file of the v2 version, the configuration items are reconstructed, so please refer to the configuration file of the v1 version to migrate the configuration items.

If the migration is difficult, please re-read the [v2 document](/getting-started) and reconfigure the configuration items again.

</Steps>

I apologize for the trouble the migration caused. If you have any questions, please submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvanNotFound/hexo-theme-redefine), or contact me by email [contact@ohevan.com](mailto:contact@ohevan.com )
