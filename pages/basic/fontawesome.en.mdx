Redefine theme includes `Fontawesome Pro v6.2.1` by default

Whether to enable:

- `fa-thin` [Thin series icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&s=thin)
- `fa-light` [Light series icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&s=light)
- `fa-duotone` [Duotone series icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&s=duotone)
