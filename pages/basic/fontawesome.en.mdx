# Fontawesome Settings

```yaml filename="_config.redefine.yml"
fontawesome: # select fontawesome versions you want to use, in order to reduce the loading time, select as few as possible
  thin: false # use fontawesome thin version or not
  light: false # use fontawesome light version or not
  duotone: false # use fontawesome duotone version or not
  sharp_solid: false # use fontawesome sharp-solid version or not
```

Redefine the built-in `Fontawesome Pro v6.2.1` version in the theme.

Enable the following options:

- `fa-thin` [Thin series icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&s=thin)
- `fa-light` [Light series icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&s=light)
- `fa-duotone` [Duotone series icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&s=duotone)
- `fa-sharp fa-solid` [Sharp Solid series icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&s=solid&f=sharp)

These four sets of icons are optional to speed up the loading time. It is recommended not to enable the unnecessary icon sets.

The three icon sets, `solid`, `regular`, and `brands`, are enabled by default to ensure the completeness of the icons.
