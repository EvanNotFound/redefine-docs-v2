# CDN acceleration

A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed system that stores content on servers closest to the user, thereby improving the speed and performance of users' access to websites. A CDN forwards a user's request to the closest server instead of forwarding the request to the website's origin server. This reduces the load on the origin server and also improves the speed at which users can access the website.

This theme supports CDN acceleration, you can enable CDN acceleration in theme settings. If the site itself is very fast, it is not recommended to enable the CDN acceleration function.

The supported services are: `elemecdn`, `aliyun`, `jsdelivr`, `personal`. It is recommended to use `elemecdn`, which has fast access speed and high stability.

## configuration

Open the theme configuration file `_config.redefine.yml`, find the `cdn` configuration item, set `enable` to `true`, and set `provider` to the CDN service provider you want to use.

```yaml filename="_config.redefine.yml"
cdn:
   # Whether to enable CDN
   enable: false
   # CDN Provider
   provider: elemecdn # elemecdn, jsdelivr, unpkg, aliyun, custom
   custom_url:
```

### Custom provider

If you want to use a custom CDN service provider, you can set `provider` to `custom` and set `custom_url` to your CDN address.

The format of `custom_url` is: `https://cdn.custom.com/hexo-theme-redefine/${version}/source/${path}`, where `${version}` will be replaced by the theme The version number, `${path}` will be replaced with the path of the theme resource.

Please note that `${path}` must be specified in the `source` directory of the theme file, otherwise it cannot be replaced correctly.
