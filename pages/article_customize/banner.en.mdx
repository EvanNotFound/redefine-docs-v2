<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">

If you set [homepage header image thumbnail](https://redefine-docs.ohevan.com/docs/advanced/home-contents/thumbnail), the article cover will also be automatically selected as `thumbnail` link, of course, `banner ` and `cover` have the highest priority.

If you don't want to set the cover of the article but want to keep the header image of the homepage, please set `cover` or `banner` to `false`
