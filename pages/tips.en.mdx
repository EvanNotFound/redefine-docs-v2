# Writing guidelines

Here are some recommended writing guidelines and precautions for the topic

## title

Please don't start Markdown articles with `# title`

Please **only** write your title in the `title:` attribute in the `front-matter` of the Markdown file

```markdown {2}

    - "Demo"
    - "Hexo"
    - "Hexo Theme"
    - "Hexo Theme Redefine"
