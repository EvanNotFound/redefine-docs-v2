## Usage

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

Add the following to the [Front Matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter.html) of the article:

```markdown
---
cover: "图片链接"
---
```

or

```markdown
---
banner: "图片链接"
---
```

For example:

```markdown
---
title: 主题样式 Demo
date: 2022-12-30 19:07:05
cover: "https://evan.beee.top/img/2023/01/21/5966cf4d2f2c05aecad54e233d9562ff.png"
---
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">

If you have set a [thumbnail for the homepage](https://redefine-docs.ohevan.com/docs/advanced/home-contents/thumbnail), the article cover will automatically be selected as the `thumbnail` link. However, the `banner` and `cover` have the highest priority.

If you do not want to set an article cover but want to keep the homepage thumbnail, set `cover` or `banner` to `false`.
