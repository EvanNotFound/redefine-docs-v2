# Resource Compression

In the theme code of Redefine, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files are not packaged and compressed.

If you want to package and compress these files, you can use the plugin [hexo-all-minifier](https://github.com/chenzhutian/hexo-all-minifier) to solve this issue, which can effectively reduce the website's loading time.

[hexo-all-minifier](https://github.com/chenzhutian/hexo-all-minifier) integrates `html-minifier`, `clean-css`, `uglify`, and `imagemin`, and it is easy to configure.

## Configuration

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>
### Install the Plugin

</Steps>

## FAQ

### Error related to Tailwind CSS when using hexo-all-minifier

When running `hexo generate` , you may encounter the following error:

```shell
ERROR Ignoring local @import of "tailwindcss" as resource is missing.
<project_root>\node_modules\hexo-theme-redefine\source\css\tailwind.source.css
```

This error usually occurs after enabling the `hexo-all-minifier` plugin, when `css_minifier` attempts to process the `tailwind.source.css` file. However, this file is only used during the development phase for Tailwind CSS to build CSS, and is not actually used as a CSS resource.

To avoid this error, in the Hexo site configuration file `_config.yml`, add the following configuration item:

```yaml filename="_config.yml"
css_minifier:
  exclude:
    - "tailwind.source.css"
```

If you encounter other issues or want to perform more detailed settings when using the plugin, please refer to the plugin's [documentation](https://github.com/chenzhutian/hexo-all-minifier/blob/master/README.md).
