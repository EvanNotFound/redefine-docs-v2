# Article Encryption

This theme comes with the `hexo-blog-encrypt` plugin, allowing you to encrypt your articles. Encrypted articles can only be accessed with the correct password.

If you have previously installed the `hexo-blog-encrypt` plugin using `npm`, please use the following command to uninstall it:

```bash
npm uninstall hexo-blog-encrypt
```

Removing this plugin is essential to ensure the smooth functioning of the theme's built-in features.

## Quick Guide

To quickly encrypt an article, add a `password` field with your desired password to the article's `Front-matter` section.

> **Tip:** If your password contains leading zeros (e.g., `0429`), wrap it in double quotes — for example: `password: "0429"`

```yaml
---
title: Article Title
date: 2020-01-01 00:00:00
password: hello
---
```
