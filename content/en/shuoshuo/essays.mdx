# Local Deployment Method

This method is written with reference to the [Instant Short Text Static Deployment Version](https://blog.zhheo.com/p/557c9e72.html) by Evan Luo, adapted for the Redefine theme.

The implementation logic is to write the content of the short text in a local `yml` file, and then generate the short text when generating the blog.

## Configuration

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

<Steps>

### Create a Short Text Page

You can choose the page name as `shuoshuo` or `essays` or `essay`.

Execute the following command in the root directory of your Hexo blog:

```shell
$ hexo new page essays
```

At this point, a page named `essays` is created.

### Edit the Page Name

Open the `/source/esssays/index.md` file (based on the page name you created), and change the `title` attribute in the `front-matter` to `说说` or `Essays` in Chinese.

Since the page template is matched based on the page name by default, if you want to change the page name to another name, please add `type: shuoshuo` in the `front-matter`.

For example:

```markdown
---
title: 测试页面
type: shuoshuo
date: 2023-03-08 10:38:34
---
```

### Create a Short Text Storage File

Create a folder `_data` under the root directory of your blog (if not created before).

Then, create a file `essays.yml` under the `_data` directory.

Write your short text content in the following format:

```yaml
- content: 第一条说说内容
  date: 2019-01-01 10:00:00 #说说日期

- content: 第二条说说内容
  date: 2019-01-02 10:00:00
```

Then, you can visit this page to see your short text content.

</Steps>

## Writing Tips

Short texts support Markdown syntax.

If you need to insert line breaks, please use the following format:

```yaml
- content: |
      说说测试，这是第四个，换行测试
      说说测试，这是第四个，换行测试
      说说测试，这是第四个，换行测试
      说说测试，这是第四个，换行测试
  date: 2019-01-04 10:00:00
```
