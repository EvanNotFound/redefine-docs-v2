In the theme code, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files are not packaged and compressed.

If you want to package and compress these files, you can use the plugin [hexo-all-minifier](https://github.com/chenzhutian/hexo-all-minifier) to solve this issue, which can effectively reduce the website's loading time.

[hexo-all-minifier](https://github.com/chenzhutian/hexo-all-minifier) integrates `html-minifier`, `clean-css`, `uglify`, and `imagemin`, and it is easy to configure.

## Configuration

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

```yaml filename="_config.yml"
