title: Mermaid JS Flowchart
---

```yaml
plugins:
	...
  mermaid: # Mermaid JS
    enable: false # enable mermaid or not
    version: "9.3.0" # default v9.3.0
```

To use Mermaid JS for drawing diagrams in Hexo, you need to install the `hexo-filter-mermaid-diagrams` npm module. You can install it by running the following command in the Hexo root directory:

```bash
npm install hexo-filter-mermaid-diagrams
```

Once installed,

- The `plugins.mermaid.enable` field is used to control whether Mermaid JS is enabled.
- The `plugins.mermaid.version` field is used to control the version of Mermaid JS.

For example, to use Mermaid JS to draw diagrams in an article, simply use the following Markdown syntax in the article:

````markdown
```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```
````

The `graph` type can be `graph`, `digraph`, `flowchart`, `gantt`, `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, or `stateDiagram`.
