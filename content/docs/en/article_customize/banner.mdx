<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">

If you have set a [thumbnail for the homepage](https://redefine-docs.ohevan.com/docs/advanced/home-contents/thumbnail), the article cover will automatically be selected as the `thumbnail` link. However, the `banner` and `cover` have the highest priority.

If you do not want to set an article cover but want to keep the homepage thumbnail, set `cover` or `banner` to `false`.
