## Getting Ready for Development

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

    ### Enabling Theme Development Mode

    To get started, set the `developer.enable` option to `true` within the theme's configuration file `_config.redefine.yml`. This file can be found in the root directory of your Hexo installation.

    ```yaml
    # DEVELOPER MODE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> start
    developer:
    # Activate developer mode (for those modifying the theme's source code; not for regular users)
    enable: true
    # DEVELOPER MODE <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< end
    ```

    ### Installing Tailwind CSS

    Begin by navigating to the theme directory and executing the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    ### Live Compilation of Tailwind CSS

    In your terminal, execute:

    ```bash
    npm run watch:css
    ```

    This will enable real-time compilation of Tailwind CSS, and the compiled CSS file will reside in `source/build/css/styles.css`.

## Frontend runtime and Swup events

- Frontend scripts now boot from a single `source/js/main.js` entry and are split into feature modules with lifecycle-driven init.
- Lifecycle utilities fire on DOM ready and after Swup navigations so SPA page switches re-mount modules.
- The Swup instance is exposed as `window.swup`; when it is ready a `redefine:swup:ready` event is dispatched so you can grab the instance and register navigation callbacks.
- Comment providers (Giscus/Gitalk/Twikoo/Waline) follow the same SPA flow with reload/retry handling.
- Mermaid ships light/dark theme config and applies the current mode at runtime.
- A new Hexo Callout tag plus CSS-variable-based callout styles replace the legacy note styles; override the variables to customize.

## Customizing Your Theme

### Tailoring Tailwind CSS

If you're eager to tweak the theme's styles using Tailwind CSS:

-   For customizing the Tailwind CSS configuration, make changes to the `tailwind.config.js` file located in the theme folder.
-   To create personalized global styles with Tailwind CSS, modify the `source/css/style.styl` file in the theme folder.

For an in-depth understanding of Tailwind CSS, consult the [official Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

### Crafting Unique Theme Styles

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS and instead wish to fashion your own theme styles, delve into the respective `.styl` style files found in the `source/css/` directory within the theme folder. Then, seamlessly integrate the CSS class you've devised into your `ejs` files.
